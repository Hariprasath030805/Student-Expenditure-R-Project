# Student-Expenditure-R-Project

📌 Project Overview

This project investigates student spending habits in campus canteens using data collected through a Google Forms survey. The data was analyzed using R programming, with models designed to visualize and predict expenditure behavior. The goal was to uncover patterns influenced by budgeting, social behavior, and academic schedules.

📌Methodology

Survey Collection

Data was collected via a structured Google Form using snowball sampling.

📎 gform.pdf contains the original questionnaire.

📌Data Analysis & Modeling in R

Four R-based models were implemented:

Model 1: Forecasting Maximum Expenditure

Model 2: Predicting Food Choices

Model 3: Bar Graph Visualization of Survey Inputs

Model 4: Hypothesis Testing (cash vs mobile payments)

📌Visualization Tools

ggplot2 for bar/pie/line graphs

Statistical tests: t-tests, ANOVA

🔍 Key Insights

Most students spend ₹0–₹100 per visit and visit 2–3 times per week.

Spending reduces significantly during exam periods.

Trends, social settings, and payment methods mildly influence purchases.

Students prefer affordable, diverse, and eco-friendly food options.

Mobile payments (like GPay) are increasingly popular.

Hypothesis testing revealed spending differences between payment modes.

✅ How to Use This Project

Clone the repository.

Open the R scripts in RStudio.

Load the dataset collected from the form.

Run the scripts to generate graphs and results.

Modify the survey or model inputs as needed.


📝 Future Work

Expand dataset with more institutions.

Incorporate income level and academic performance data.

Enhance models with machine learning (e.g., random forests).

Add dashboard or Shiny app for interactive exploration.
